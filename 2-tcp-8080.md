## Expose ownCloud publicly on TCP/8080

On the [installation page](/install/) of this guide, we set the external port Docker
will expose ownCloud with the following definition.

```
export PUBLIC_HTTP_PORT=80
```

The port assignment is then set when we run the ownCloud Docker image with the following
parameter.

```
-p ${PUBLIC_HTTP_PORT}:8080
```

If you prefer a different port, 8080 for example, then change the value assigned to the
desired port number.

```
export PUBLIC_HTTP_PORT=8080
```

Also when connecting you will need to specifiy this port explicitly if it is not port 80:

```
http://54.39.22.182:8080
```

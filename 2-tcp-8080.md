## Expose ownCloud publicly on TCP/8080

On the installation page of this guide, we set the external port Docker
will expose ownCloud with the following definition.

```
export HTTP_PORT=80
```

The port assignment is then set when we run the ownCloud Docker image with the following
parameter.

```
-p ${HTTP_PORT}:8080
```

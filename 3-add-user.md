## Add a user to ownCloud

### Introduction

Adding a user to ownCloud is simple. Log in to ownCloud using the
admin credentials you created during installation. After logging in,
you will find your username, "owncloud" in the top right corner of the
browser. Click the name to expose a drop down list and select "Users".

At the top of the user management screen place the name of the new
user you wish to create and their email address in the appropriate
text fields. Optionally drop down the "Groups" menu and choose an 
existing group or create a new one. When you are finished, click 
"Create".

After the user creation completes, optionally select the pencil icon
next to the new user's password in the table, and change it.

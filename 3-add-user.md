## Add a user to ownCloud

admin credentials you created during installation. After logging in,
you will find your username, "owncloud" in the top right corner of the
browser. Click the name to expose a drop down list and select "Users".

user you wish to create and their email address in the appropriate
text fields. Optionally drop down the "Groups" menu and choose an 
existing group or create a new one. When you are finished, click 
"Create".

## Add a user to ownCloud

### Introduction

Adding a user to ownCloud is simple. Log in to ownCloud using the
admin credentials you created during installation. After logging in,
you will find your username, "admin" in the top right corner of the
browser. Click the name to expose a drop down list and select "Users".
At the top of the user management screen enter the name of the new
user you wish to create and their email address. Optionally drop down
the "Groups" menu and choose an existing group or create a new one.

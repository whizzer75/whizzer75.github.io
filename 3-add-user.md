## Add a user to ownCloud

### Introduction

Log in to [ownCloud] using the admin credentials created during 
installation. In [this guide](/install/) the username was "owncloud" which you 
will find in the top right corner of the browser after logging in. 
Click the name to expose a drop down list and select "Users".

At the top of the user management screen, type the name of the new
user you wish to create and their email address in the appropriate
text fields. Optionally, drop down the "Groups" menu and choose an 
existing group or create a new one. When you are finished, click 
"Create".

![Create a new user][create_user]

Optionally, select the pencil icon next to the new user's password
in the table to change it.

After logging out, you should be able to log in with the
new credentials.
